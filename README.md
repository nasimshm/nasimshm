<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nasim</h1>

<p>I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas - Arlington. </p>

<p>My research projects involve Knowledge Graphs, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Mining. More specifically, I am working on building a system which can efficiently discover exceptional facts from knowledge graphs. Furthermore, I am studying the effectiveness of link prediction algorithms for large real knowledge graphs and working on creating datasts which facilitate research on this task and more.</p>
